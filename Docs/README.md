# Telemedicine Platform Documentation

## 1. Problem Statement
Access to healthcare services is often hindered by multiple challenges, including:
- **Long Waiting Times:** Patients struggle to get timely appointments due to high demand and inefficient scheduling.
- **Difficulty in Finding the Right Doctor:** Patients often face challenges in identifying the right specialist based on symptoms.
- **Limited Access to Healthcare:** People in remote areas face difficulty in reaching medical professionals.
- **Inefficient Appointment Booking:** Manual scheduling causes delays, cancellations, and mismanagement.
- **Lack of AI-Powered Diagnostic Tools:** Doctors manually analyze cases, which takes time and increases the risk of human error.
- **Absence of a Seamless Online Consultation & Prescription System:** Current systems do not provide a comprehensive digital healthcare experience.
- **Poor Mental Health Support:** There is a gap in AI-powered chatbot assistance for mental health management.
