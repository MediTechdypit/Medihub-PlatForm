# Telemedicine Platform Documentation

## 1. Problem Statement
Access to healthcare services is often hindered by multiple challenges, including:
- **Long Waiting Times:** Patients struggle to get timely appointments due to high demand and inefficient scheduling.
- **Difficulty in Finding the Right Doctor:** Patients often face challenges in identifying the right specialist based on symptoms.
- **Limited Access to Healthcare:** People in remote areas face difficulty in reaching medical professionals.
- **Inefficient Appointment Booking:** Manual scheduling causes delays, cancellations, and mismanagement.
- **Lack of AI-Powered Diagnostic Tools:** Doctors manually analyze cases, which takes time and increases the risk of human error.
- **Absence of a Seamless Online Consultation & Prescription System:** Current systems do not provide a comprehensive digital healthcare experience.
- **Poor Mental Health Support:** There is a gap in AI-powered chatbot assistance for mental health management.

## 2. Explanation of the Problem Statement
Healthcare inefficiencies impact both patients and doctors. Patients face delayed appointments and difficulty in selecting the right doctor, while doctors struggle with time-consuming administrative tasks. In emergencies, immediate consultation is needed, but the current system lacks an effective emergency response mechanism. Mental health concerns are also not adequately addressed, as many individuals do not have access to immediate mental health support.
